1. A die member for a self-piercing riveting process, the member comprising a die cavity having an axis and a number N of flat sides positioned about the axis, wherein each side lies along a plane including a chord connecting two points along a circle centered on the axis, and wherein an included angle between radii extending from the axis to opposite ends of any chord is equal to 360/N degrees.
    2. The die member of claim 1 wherein each plane along which an associated side extends is parallel to the axis.
    3. The die member of claim 1 wherein the die member further comprises a bearing surface, wherein the die cavity has a floor, and wherein each plane along which an associated side extends is perpendicular to a plane defined by the bearing surface and is also perpendicular to a plane defined by cavity floor.
    4. The die member of claim 1 wherein the die member further comprises a bearing surface, wherein the die cavity has a floor, and wherein a plane along which at least one side of the plurality of sides extends is angled toward the axis in a direction proceeding from the bearing surface toward the floor.
    5. A die member for a self-piercing riveting process, the die member comprising a die cavity formed in the die member, a perimeter of the cavity being formed by a plurality of sides and a plurality of fillet radii, each end of each side being connected by a fillet radius to an adjacent side at an end of the adjacent side, wherein each radius r has a value within the range 0.25 mm-3.25 mm inclusive.
    6. The die member of claim 1 wherein the number of cavity sides is within the range of 3-20 inclusive.
    7. The die member of claim 6 wherein each side has a length, and wherein the lengths of all of the sides are equal.
    8. The die member of claim 1 wherein the number of cavity sides is equal to twelve.
    9. The die member of claim 16 wherein the number of cavity sides is within the range of 3-20 inclusive.
    10. The die member of claim 5 wherein the number of cavity sides is within the range of 3-20 inclusive.
    11. The die member of claim 5 wherein each of the sides is straight.
    12. A die member for a self-piercing riveting process, the die member comprising:a bearing surface;a die cavity formed in the bearing surface, the die cavity including a floor and a central axis extending through the floor;a plurality of flat sides extending between the floor and the bearing surface,wherein at least one of the sides is sloped away from the axis in a direction proceeding from the floor toward the bearing surface.
    13. The die member of claim 12 wherein the number of cavity sides is within the range of 3-20 inclusive.
    14. The die member of claim 12 wherein the number of straight cavity sides is equal to twelve.
    15. The die member of claim 12 wherein each of the sides is straight.
