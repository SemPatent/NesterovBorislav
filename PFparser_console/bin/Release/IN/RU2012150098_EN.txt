 1. A computer program product for facilitating memory access, the computer program product comprising:a computer readable storage medium readable by a processing circuit and storing instructions for execution by the processing circuit for performing a method comprising:responsive to executing a Modify PCI Function Controls (MPFC) instruction that specifies a handle for locating an adapter, a pointer for locating one or more translation tables and a format for selecting a translation format of a plurality of available translation formats, setting a translation format, associated by way of the handle, with an adapter;responsive to receiving a request from the adapter, obtaining at runtime an indication of the translation format to be used in providing an address usable in accessing memory, said translation format being pre-registered for the adapter, the request having an initial address to be used in providing the address usable in accessing memory; anddetermining the direct memory access (DMA) address usable in accessing memory based on the obtained translation format and the initial address, the initial address generated by the adapter; andstoring or fetching adapter data at the DMA address.
    2. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein the plurality of available translation formats includes one or more of the following formats: a selected central processing unit dynamic address translation (CPU DAT) compatible format, a chosen input/output (I/O) extended address translation format which uses one or more extended address translation tables, a bypass format in which address translation is bypassed, or a no fetch format in which no address translation tables are fetched.
    3. The computer program product of claim 2, wherein the obtaining obtains an indication that the translation format is the bypass format, and wherein the determining determines that the address usable in accessing memory is the initial address, responsive to the translation format being the bypass format.
    4. The computer program product of claim 3, wherein the bypass format is selected based on the adapter being a trusted adapter.
    5. The computer program product of claim 2, wherein the obtaining obtains an indication that the translation format is the no fetch format, and wherein the determining determines the address usable in accessing memory using the initial address and a pointer to a highest level address translation table to be used in determining the address.
    6. The computer program product of claim 2, wherein the obtaining obtains an indication that the translation format is the selected CPU DAT compatible format, and wherein the determining determines the address using the initial address and one or more CPU DAT compatible translation tables.
    7. The computer program product of claim 6, wherein the CPU DAT compatible format comprises one of a 4 k CPU DAT compatible format or a 1M CPU DAT compatible format.
    8. The computer program product of claim 2, wherein the obtaining obtains an indication that the translation format is the chosen I/O extended address translation format, and wherein the determining determines the address using the initial address and one or more I/O translation tables.
    9. The computer program product of claim 8, wherein the chosen I/O extended address translation format comprises one of a 4 k address translation tables with 4 k pages format, a 1M address translation tables with 4 k pages format, or a 1M address translation tables with 1M pages format.
    10. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein the obtaining comprises checking a format indicator in a device table entry associated with the adapter to obtain the indication of translation format to be used.
    11. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein the setting comprises indicating in a device table entry associated with the adapter the selected translation format.
    12. The computer program product of claim 1, wherein the translation format registered for the adapter is different from another translation format registered for another adapter.
    13. A computer system for facilitating memory access, the computer system comprising:a memory; anda processor in communications with the memory, wherein the computer system is configured to perform a method, said method comprising:responsive to executing a Modify PCI Function Controls (MPFC) instruction that specifies a handle for locating an adapter, a pointer for locating one or more translation tables and a format for selecting a translation format of a plurality of available translation formats, setting a translation format, associated by way of the handle, with an adapter;responsive to receiving a request from the adapter, obtaining at runtime an indication of the translation format to be used in providing an address usable in accessing memory, said translation format being pre-registered for the adapter, the request having an initial address to be used in providing the address usable in accessing memory; anddetermining the direct memory access (DMA) address usable in accessing memory based on the obtained translation format and the initial address, the initial address generated by the adapter; andstoring or fetching adapter data at the DMA address.
    14. The computer system of claim 13, wherein the plurality of available translation formats includes one or more of the following formats: a selected central processing unit dynamic address translation (CPU DAT) compatible format, a chosen input/output (I/O) extended address translation format which uses one or more extended address translation tables, a bypass format in which address translation is bypassed, or a no fetch format in which no address translation tables are fetched.
