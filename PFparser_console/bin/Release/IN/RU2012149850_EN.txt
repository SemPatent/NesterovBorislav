 1. A double cylinder system, comprising:at least one controller being adapted to transmit control signals, said controller further comprises:a control cavity; anda first piston within said control cavity, said first piston dividing said control cavity into a first control cavity portion and a second control cavity portion and preventing communication between said first control cavity portion and said second control cavity portion;at least one slave being in communication with said controller and being configured to respond to said control signals transmitted by said controller, said slave comprisinga slave cavity; anda second piston within said slave cavity, said second piston dividing said slave cavity into a first slave cavity portion and a second slave cavity portion and preventing communication between said first slave cavity portion and said second slave cavity portion; andat least one control line providing communication between said first control cavity portion and said first slave cavity portion; andat least one control line providing communication between said second control cavity portion and said second slave cavity portion.
    2. The system of claim 1, further comprising a manipulator, wherein said manipulator is adapted to change the position of said first piston within said control cavity.
    3. The system of claim 2 wherein said manipulator is coupled with a telemanipulation device.
    4. The system of claim 1 wherein said control signals are generated by a telemanipulation device.
    5. A surgical device, comprising:at least one controller located at a proximal end of the device, said controller being adapted to transmit control signals;at least one manipulator, said manipulator being configured to be controlled by a human hand and to actuate said controller;at least one slave located at a distal end of the device, said slave being in communication with said controller and being configured to respond to said control signals transmitted by said controller; andat least one control line providing communication between said controller and said slave.
    6. The surgical device of claim 5 wherein said manipulator is remote to said controller.
    7. The surgical device of claim 6 wherein said manipulator is coupled with said controller by a telemanipulation device.
    8. The surgical device of claim 5 wherein said control signals are generated by a telemanipulation device.
    9. A surgical device, comprising:a control portion located at a proximal end of the device, comprising:a plurality of controllers, each of said plurality of controllers being adapted to transmit control signals; anda plurality of manipulators, each of said plurality of manipulators being configured to actuate a corresponding one of said plurality of controllers;a slave portion located at a distal end of the device, comprising:a plurality of slaves, each of said plurality of slaves being in communication with a corresponding one of said plurality of controllers and being configured to respond to said control signals transmitted by said corresponding one of said plurality of controllers; andan intermediate portion, comprising a plurality of control lines, each of said plurality of control lines providing communication with one of said plurality of controllers and a corresponding one of said plurality of slaves.
    10. The surgical device of claim 9 wherein at least one of said controllers is remote to said plurality of said manipulators.
    11. The surgical device of claim 9 wherein at least one of said controllers is coupled to one of said plurality of said manipulators by a telemanipulation device.
    12. The surgical device of claim 9 wherein said control signals are generated by a telemanipulation device.
    13. The surgical device of claim 9, wherein said communication is through a direct mechanical connection.
    14. The surgical device of claim 9, wherein said communication is through an indirect mechanical connection.
    15. The surgical device of claim 9, wherein said communication is through a telemanipulation device.
