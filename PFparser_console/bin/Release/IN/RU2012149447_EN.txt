The plate (2) according to any one of claims 3 and 4, wherein said ridges and grooves of said third corrugations are directed at an angle of between &gt; 90 - &lt; 135 degrees with said first line (26) measured in said angular direction and said ridges and grooves of said fourth corrugations are directed at an angle of between &gt; 225 - &lt; 270 degrees with said first line (26) measured in said angular direction. 6. The plate (2) according to any one of claims 2-5, wherein said first general direction and /or said second general direction comprise/s one or more angles between 0 - &lt;90 degrees in relation to said second line (27). 7. The plate (2) according to any one of claims 2-6, wherein said first outer area (18) and/or said second outer area (20) have/has a width measured in parallel with said second line (27), which is narrower than said first field (30) measured in parallel with said second line (27). 8. The plate (2) according to any one of claims 2-7, wherein said first and/or second protrusions and recesses in said first outer area (18) and/or said second outer area (20) comprise corrugations in the form of ridges and grooves. 9. The plate (2) according to claim 8, wherein in said first and second outer areas (18, 20) said ridges have a different width than said grooves measured across said ridges and grooves. 10. The plate (2) according to any one of claims 2-9, wherein said first protrusions and recesses are directed in a first direction in relation to said second line (27) and/or said second protrusions and recesses are directed in a second direction in relation to said second line (27). 1 1 .
