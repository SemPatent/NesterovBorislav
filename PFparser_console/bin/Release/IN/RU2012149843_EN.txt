Claims 1 . A boiler for producing thermal energy, the boiler (1 ) comprising:  - a furnace (2) limited by walls;  - at least one steam superheater (15) placed on a wall of the furnace and having at least one heat exchange surface (21 ) for receiving thermal energy;  characterized in that the boiler also comprises:  - at least one supply device (17) for supplying gas or a gas mixture to the front of said heat exchange surface to form a barrier layer (18) to protect the heat exchange surface from the flue gases (19) in the boiler. 2. The boiler according to claim 1 , characterized in that the boiler (1 ) further comprises:  - devices (6) for supplying fuel to the furnace for combustion;  - devices (3, 7, 8) for supplying combustion gas to the furnace for combustion;  - one or more flue gas ducts (1 1 ) placed in the upper part of the furnace and discharging the flue gases (19) formed during the combustion from the furnace. 3. The boiler according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the boiler is a boiler based on fluidized bed combustion, a soda recovery boiler, or a boiler based on combustion on a grate. 4. The boiler according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said supply device comprises an orifice (24), a pipe or a duct (20), or an orifice (23), fitted in the superheater or in the direct vicinity of the superheater. 5. The boiler according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the superheater comprises pipes (22) connected to each other, inside which the steam flows. 6. The boiler according to any of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the boiler comprises a supply device matrix comprising several said supply devices provided to supply gas or a gas mixture to the front of said heat exchange surface, to form a uniform barrier layer (18). 7. A boiler superheater provided on the wall of a boiler (1 ) for producing thermal energy, the wall delimiting the furnace (2) of the boiler, and the superheater (15) comprising at least one heat exchange surface (21 ) for receiving thermal energy, characterized in that at least one supply device (17) is provided in the superheater or in the direct vicinity of the superheater, for supplying gas or a gas mixture to the front of said heat exchange surface, to form a barrier layer (18) to protect the heat exchange surface from flue gases (19) in the boiler. 8. The superheater according to claim 7, characterized in that a supply device matrix is provided in the area defined by the superheater, the matrix comprising several said supply devices provided to supply gas or a gas mixture to the front of said heat exchange surface, to form a uniform barrier layer (18). 9. A method in a boiler (1 ) producing thermal energy, the method comprising: - combustion of fuel and combustion air in the furnace (2) of the boiler, delimited by walls;  - receiving of thermal energy by a steam superheater (15) placed on a wall of the furnace and having at least one heat exchange surface (21 ); characterized in that the method also comprises:  - supplying of gas or a gas mixture to the front of the heat exchange surface, to form a barrier layer (18) for protecting the heat exchange surface from flue gases (19) developed in connection with the combustion. 10. The method according to claim 9, characterized in that the gas or gas mixture is air or a corrosion inhibitor, particularly sulphur dioxide or sulphide. 1 1 . The method according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the method further comprises: - supplying of gas or gas mixture from several different locations into the area delimited by the superheater, to the front of said heat exchange surface, to form a uniform barrier layer (18). 12. The method according to any of the claims 9 to 1 1 , characterized in that the method further comprises:  - supplying of gas or gas mixture to the barrier layer by using at least one gas supply device (17) placed in the superheater or in the direct vicinity of the superheater, or by using a supply device matrix comprising several said supply devices and placed in the area delimited by the superheater.
