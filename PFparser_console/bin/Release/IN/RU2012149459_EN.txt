1.A process for reducing the particle size of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) while maintaining its polymorphic form, which process comprises the step of processing the active pharmaceutical ingredient by cavitation at elevated pressure. 2.A process according to claim 1 wherein the active ingredient is suspended in a solvent in which it is not soluble. 3.A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the solvent is water, heptane, an alcohol, a ketone or an alkane, or a mixture of two or more of the above. 4. A process according to claim 1 , 2 or 3, characterized by the cavitation pressure being from 300 to 3500 bar. 5. A process according to any preceding claim further comprising the step of isolating the processed active ingredient in the form of powder. 6. A process according to claim 5 wherein the isolation step comprises filtration or spray drying. 7. A process according to claim 6 wherein the isolation step comprises spray drying. 8. A process according to claim 7 wherein the spray drying step is done immediately following the cavitation step. 9. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the active pharmaceutical ingredient is suitable for topical delivery to the lungs or nose. 10. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the the active ingredient is mometasone, Fluticasone, tiotropium, ciclesonide, budesonide, formoterol, salmeterol, salbutamol, beclomethasone, betamethasone, ipratropium, terbutaline, or hydrocortisone, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester of one of the above, or a combination of two or more of the above active pharmaceutical ingredients or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters. 11. A process according to claim 10 wherein the active ingredient is mometasone furoate or mometasone furoate monohydrate; fluticasone proprionate or fluticasone furoate; tiotropium bromide or tiotropium bromide monohydrate; ciclesonide; budesonide; formoterol; salmeterol; salbutamol; beclomethasone dipropionate; betamethasone acetate; ipratropium; terbutaline; or hydrocortisone 7-propionate 21- acetate, or a combination of two or more of these active pharmaceutical ingredients. 12. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the active ingredient is mometasone furoate monohydrate, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, salmeterol xinafoate or tiotropium bromide. 13. A process according to any preceding claim wherein the particle size distribution of the active pharmaceutical ingredient comprises a span of less than 2.5. 14. A process according to claim 13 wherein the span is less than 2.0. 15. A process according to claim 13 or 14 wherein the span is less than 1.8. 16. A process for making a pharmaceutical composition which comprises carrying out a process according to any preceding claim, and then combining the active pharmaceutical ingredient with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.
