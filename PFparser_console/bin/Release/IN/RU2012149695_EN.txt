 1. A method of treating a pain condition in a mammal, the method comprising administering to the mammal a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent which is 4-[2-(2,4,6-trifluoro-phenoxymethyl)-phenyl]-piperidine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an opioid agonist agent.
    2. The method of claim 1 wherein the opioid agonist agent is administered at a dose that is lower than a dose administered for treating a pain condition when used alone.
    3. The method of claim 1 wherein the opioid agonist agent is morphine.
    4. The method of claim 1 wherein the opioid agonist agent is oxycodone.
    5. The method of claim 1 wherein the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent is 4-[2-(2,4,6-trifluoro-phenoxymethyl)-phenyl]-piperidine hydrochloride.
    6. The method of claim 1 wherein the pain condition is chronic pain.
    7. The method of claim 1 wherein the mammal is a human.
    8. The method of claim 2 wherein the opioid agonist agent is morphine.
    9. The method of claim 2 wherein the opioid agonist agent is oxycodone.
    10. The method of claim 2 wherein the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent is administered at a dose that is lower than a dose administered for treating a pain condition when used alone.
    11. The method of claim 2 wherein the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent and the opioid agonist agent are administered by different routes of administration.
    12. A method of producing analgesia in a mammal, the method comprising administering to the mammal a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent which is 4-[2-(2,4,6-trifluoro-phenoxymethyl)-phenyl]-piperidine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an opioid agonist agent.
    13. The method of claim 12 wherein the opioid agonist agent is administered at a dose that is lower than a dose administered for producing analgesia when used alone.
    14. The method of claim 12 wherein the opioid agonist agent is morphine.
    15. The method of claim 12 wherein the opioid agonist agent is oxycodone.
    16. The method of claim 12 wherein the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent is 4-[2-(2,4,6-trifluoro-phenoxymethyl)-phenyl]-piperidine hydrochloride.
    17. The method of claim 12 wherein the mammal is a human.
    18. The method of claim 13 wherein the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent is administered at a dose that is less than a dose administered for producing analgesia when used alone.
    19. The method of claim 13 wherein the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent and the opioid agonist agent are administered by different routes of administration.
    20. A pharmaceutical composition comprising 4-[2-(2,4,6-trifluoro-phenoxymethyl)-phenyl]-piperidine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, an opioid agonist agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
    21. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 20 wherein the opioid agonist agent is morphine or oxycodone.
    22. A method of treating a pain condition in a mammal, the method comprising administering to the mammal a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent and an opioid agonist agent wherein the opioid agonist agent is administered at a dose that is less than the dose administered for treating a pain condition when used alone and wherein the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor exhibits a ratio of SERT to NET IC50 values determined in an in vitro neurotransmitter uptake assay of between about 2 and about 40.
    23. The method of claim 22 wherein the opioid agonist agent is morphine or oxycodone.
    24. The method of claim 23 wherein the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor agent is administered at a dose that is less than a dose administered for treating a pain condition when used alone.
