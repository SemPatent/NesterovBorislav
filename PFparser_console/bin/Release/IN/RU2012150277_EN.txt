    9.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the identification unit is further configured to:  determine a characteristic of a first gesture, based on a comparison between the first spatial position and at least one spatial position of the pose information that corresponds to the first reference point.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    10.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the characteristic comprises at least one of a speed, a displacement, or an angular displacement.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    11.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 9, wherein the identification unit is further configured to:  identify the group of objects based on at least the first spatial position and the characteristic of the first gesture.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    12.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the identification unit is further configured to:  assign a generic command to the first spatial position, when the first spatial position fails to be associated with the first gesture.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    13.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the determination unit is further configured to:  determine whether the second spatial position is associated with a second gesture, based on at least the retrieved pose information.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    14.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 13, wherein the determination unit is further configured to:  compare the second spatial position to the pose information associated with the second reference point; and  determine that the second spatial position is associated with the second gesture, when the second spatial position corresponds to at least one of the spatial positions of the pose information associated with the second reference point.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    15.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the selection unit is further configured to:  assign a second command to the second spatial position, when the second spatial position is associated with the second gesture.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    16.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 15, wherein the selection unit is further configured to:  select the object of the identified group based on at least the second command.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    17.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising:  an imaging unit configured to capture an image comprising at least the first and second portions of the human body.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    18.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the receiving unit is further configured to:  process the captured image to identify the first spatial position and the second spatial position.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    19.  &lt;claim-text&gt;The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising:  a unit configured to perform a function corresponding to the selected object.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    20.  &lt;claim-text&gt;A computer-implemented method for gestural control of an interface, comprising:  receiving a first spatial position associated with a first portion of the human body, and a second spatial position associated with a second portion of the human body;  identifying a group of objects based on at least the first spatial position; and  selecting, using a processor, an object of the identified group based on at least the second spatial position.  &lt;/claim-text&gt; 
    21.  &lt;claim-text&gt;A non-transitory, computer-readable storage medium storing a program that, when executed by a processor, causes a processor to perform a method for gestural control of an interface, comprising:  receiving a first spatial position associated with a first portion of the human body, and a second spatial position associated with a second portion of the human body;  identifying a group of objects based on at least the first spatial position; and  selecting an object of the identified group based on at least the second spatial position.&lt;/claim-text&gt;
