Claims 1. A coffee extract comprising at least 1 milligram of a multivalent ion per gram of coffee solids. 2. The coffee extract of claim 1 comprising between 10 milligram and 200 milligram of a multivalent ion per gram of coffee solids. 3. The coffee extract of any of claims 1 or 2 being a dried coffee extract 4. The coffee extract of any of the preceding claims wherein the multivalent ion is selected among an ion of calcium, zinc, magnesium, iron, and combinations thereof. 5. The coffee extract of any of the preceding claims wherein the multivalent ion is in the form of calcium oxide, calcium lactate, calcium hydroxide, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium gluconate, zinc sulfate, magnesium chloride, or a combination thereof. 6. A method of producing a coffee extract, comprising: a) extracting coffee beans with water to obtain an aqueous coffee extract; and b) adding a multivalent ion to the coffee extract in an amount of at least 1 milligram per gram of coffee solids. 7. The method of claim 6 comprising adding a multivalent ion to the coffee extract in step b) in an amount of between 1 milligram and 200 milligram per gram of coffee solids. 8. The method of any of claims 6 or 7 further comprising drying the coffee extract after addition of a multivalent ion to produce a dry soluble coffee product. 9. The method of any of claims 6-8 wherein the multivalent ion is selected among an ion of calcium, zinc, magnesium, iron, and combinations thereof. 10. The method of any of claims 6-9 wherein the multivalent ion is added in the form of calcium oxide, calcium lactate, calcium hydroxide, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium gluconate, zinc sulfate, magnesium chloride, or a combination thereof. 11. Use of a multivalent ion to improve the foamability and/or the foam stability of a coffee extract.
