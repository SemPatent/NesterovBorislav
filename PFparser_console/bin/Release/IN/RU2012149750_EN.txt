 1. A bill for headwear, the bill having first and second opposed surfaces and comprising a retaining means arranged to automatically retain the bill in either of a first curved state in which the first side of the bill is convex and the second side concave and a second, oppositely, curved state in which the first side is concave and the second side is convex when the bill is urged towards the first or second states respectively. 2. A bill as claimed in claim 1 wherein the retaining means comprises a curved elongate member. 3. A bill as claimed in claim 1 wherein the elongate member has a substantially circular cross-section. 4. A bill as claimed in either claim 2 or 3 wherein the elongate member is resilient. 5. A bill as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4 wherein the elongate member is rotatably secured to the bill to enable it to rotate relative to the bill as the bill is urged between the first and second curved states. 6. A bill as claimed in claim 5 wherein the elongate member is secured to the body of a stiffening member comprised in the bill. 7. A bill as claimed in claim 6 wherein the elongate member is secured along an edge of the body of the stiffening member. 8. A bill as claimed in any of claims 2 to 7 wherein the elongate member is secured to the bill or body of the stiffening member by stitches. 9.
