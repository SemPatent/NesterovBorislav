 1. A method of sending information in a wireless communication network, comprising:sending a reference signal in a first part of a subframe in accordance with a multicast/broadcast single frequency network (MBSFN) subframe format; andsending unicast information in a second part of the subframe to at least one station recognizing the subframe as carrying unicast information.
    2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:sending system information conveying the subframe as an MBSFN subframe.
    3. The method of claim 1, further comprising:sending signaling conveying the subframe as carrying unicast information for the at least one station.
    4. The method of claim 1, wherein the sending the reference signal comprises sending the reference signal in the first part of the subframe to stations expecting the subframe to be an MBSFN subframe.
    5. The method of claim 1, further comprising:sending control information in the first part of the subframe in accordance with the MBSFN subframe format to stations expecting the subframe to be an MBSFN subframe.
    6. The method of claim 1, further comprising:sending the reference signal from at most four antennas in the first part of the subframe, andsending the reference signal from at least one additional antenna in the second part of the subframe.
    7. The method of claim 1, wherein the sending unicast information in the second part of the subframe comprises sending at least one of unicast data and control information in the second part of the subframe to the at least one station.
    8. The method of claim 1, wherein the sending unicast information in the second part of the subframe comprises sending a dedicated reference signal in the second part of the subframe to a station among the at least one station.
    9. The method of claim 1, wherein the sending unicast information in the second part of the subframe comprisessending a dedicated reference signal with beamforming in the second part of the subframe to a station among the at least one station, and sending unicast information for the station with beamforming in the second part of the subframe.
    10. The method of claim 1, further comprising:sending a channel quality indicator (CQI) reference signal in the second part of the subframe.
    11. The method of claim 1, further comprising:sending unicast information in the first part of the subframe.
    12. The method of claim 1, wherein the at least one station supports a release later than 3GPP Release 8.
    13. An apparatus for wireless communication, comprising:means for sending a reference signal in a first part of a subframe in accordance with a multicast/broadcast single frequency network (MBSFN) subframe format; andmeans for sending unicast information in a second part of the subframe to at least one station recognizing the subframe as carrying unicast information.
