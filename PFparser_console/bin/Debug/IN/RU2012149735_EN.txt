1. An information processing apparatus comprising:a communication unit that performs near-field one-to-one communication with a first communication counterpart device;an information acquisition unit that acquires content information retained by the first communication counterpart device through communication with the first communication counterpart device;a display processing unit that performs a process for displaying the content information acquired by the information acquisition unit; anda display unit that displays the content information.
    2. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1,wherein the content information retained by the first communication counterpart device is moving image content being reproduced by the first communication counterpart device, andwherein the display unit displays the moving image content being reproduced by the first communication counterpart device midstream in reproduction.
    3. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising:an information transmission unit that transmits the content information retained by the first communication counterpart device to the second communication counterpart device,wherein the communication unit performs near-field one-to-one communication with a second communication counterpart device in addition to the first communication counterpart device.
    4. The information processing apparatus according to claim 3, further comprising:an operation detection unit that detects an operation on the display unit,wherein the information transmission unit transmits the content information when an operation for the content information displayed on the display unit is detected.
    5. The information processing apparatus according to claim 3,wherein the information transmission unit transmits the content information retained by the first communication counterpart device by converting the format thereof.
    6. The information processing apparatus according to claim 3,wherein the information transmission unit transmits content information that the first communication counterpart device does not retain among content information that the its own apparatus retains.
    7. The information processing apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising:a location detection unit that detects the locations of the first and the second communication counterpart devices,wherein the information transmission unit changes content information to be transmitted to the second communication counterpart device according to the distance between the first communication counterpart device and the second communication counterpart device.
    8. The information processing apparatus according to claim 3,wherein the content transmission unit transmits the content information so that the ratio of synchronizing the content information of the first communication counterpart device and the second communication counterpart device increases as the distance between the first communication counterpart device and the second communication counterpart device becomes shorter.
    9. An information processing system comprising:a first device that performs communication with a second device using near-field one-to-one communication; anda second device that includes a communication unit that performs near-field one-to-one communication with the first device, an information acquisition unit that acquires content information retained by the first device through communication with the first device, a display processing unit that performs a process for displaying the content information acquired by the information acquisition unit, and a display unit that displays the content information.
    10. A program that causes a computer to function as:means for performing near-field one-to-one communication with a communication counterpart device;means for acquiring content information retained by the first communication counterpart device through communication with the communication counterpart device; andmeans for performing a process for displaying the content information.
