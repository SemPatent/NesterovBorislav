The collection of claim 1 , further comprising a third cartridge assembly(14, 20) having a fastener (316, 328, 402-428) comprising a third coding feature unique to a third medicament contained in the third cartridge assembly that is different than the first and second medicaments and where the third cartridge assembly operably connects to a third dose setting member that is different from other dose setting members in the family of delivery devices. 3. The collection of claim 1 or 2, wherein all the fasteners (316, 328, 402- 428) of the cartridge assemblies (14, 20) in the collection are of the same type selected from the group consisting of threads, pins & grooves, pins & ridges, bayonet, snap-fit, and detents, and wherein each coding feature on each fastener is different from all the other coding features on the other fasteners on the cartridge assemblies in the collection. 4. The collection of claim 1 or 2, wherein each fastener (316, 328, 402-428) on each of the cartridge assemblies (14, 20) in the collection is of a different type and is selected from the group consisting of threads, pins & grooves, pins & ridges, bayonet, snap-fit, and detents, and wherein each coding feature on each fastener is different from all the other coding features on the other fasteners on the cartridge assemblies in the collection. 5. The collection of any of claims 1 to 4, where each fastener (316, 328, 402- 428) in the collection of cartridge assemblies (14, 20) has two or more coding features. 6. The collection of any of claims 1 to 5, where each coding feature of each fastener (316, 328, 402-428) in the collection of cartridge assemblies (14, 20) comprises at least one protrusion that has a ridge feature and where all the complementary coding features on all of the dose setting members (12) in the collection comprise a pin feature configured to engage the ridge feature. 7. The collection of any of claims 1 to 6, where each coding feature of each fastener (316, 328, 402-428) in the collection of cartridge assemblies (14, 20) comprises at least one groove configured to accept a pin located on all the complementary coding features on all of the dose setting members (12) in the collection. 8. The collection of any of claims 1 to 7, where each coding feature of each fastener (316, 328, 402-428) in the collection of cartridge assemblies (14, 20) comprises a pair of pins, and the complementary coding feature on the dose setting member comprises a ridge feature, wherein the pins are axially offset from each other. 9. The collection of any of claims 1 to 8, where each fastener (316, 328, 402-428) in the collection of cartridge assemblies (14, 20) comprises a screw thread and each coding feature of each fastener has a different pitch, number of turns, or angle of threads that is unique to a specific medicament (26). 10. The collection of any of claims 1 to 9, where each coding feature of each fastener (316, 328, 402-428) in the collection of cartridge assemblies (14, 20) comprises at least one pin and where all the complementary coding features on all of the dose setting members in the collection comprise a complementary pin feature. 1 1 . The collection of any of claims 1 to 10, wherein each fastener (316, 328, 402-428) in the collection of cartridge assemblies (14, 20) is coded by a position of the fastener relative to a detent. 12. The collection of any of claims 1 to 1 1 , where the first cartridge assembly (14, 20) comprises a tubular member (1 1 , 22), the first medicament being provided in the tubular member. 13. The collection of claim 12, where the fastener of the first cartridge assembly (14, 20) is provided at a proximal end of the tubular member (1 1 , 22). 14. The collection of claim 12 or 13, where the tubular member (1 1 , 22) has a cylindrical inner surface and a cylindrical outer surface, the fastener (316, 328, 402-428) being provided on the cylindrical inner surface or on the cylindrical outer surface. 15. The collection of any of claims 1 to 14, where the respective delivery device (10) is an injection device. 16. A family comprising a plurality of delivery devices (10), each delivery device comprising a cartridge assembly (14, 20) containing a medicament (26), the cartridge assembly being connected to an associated dose setting member (12) to form the delivery device, the dose setting members and cartridge assemblies of the plurality of delivery devices being chosen from a collection as claimed in any of the previous claims, wherein the cartridge assemblies and dose setting members are configured such that the cartridge assembly of one of the delivery devices will not connect to the dose setting member of another one of the plurality of delivery devices and such that the dose setting member of one of the delivery devices will not connect to the cartridge assembly of another one of the delivery devices.
