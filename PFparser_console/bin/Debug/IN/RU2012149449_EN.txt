1. A heat generation amount estimation unit for battery for electric power tool, which is provided in an apparatus for electric power tool and estimates a heat generation amount of a battery that is a power source of an electric power tool, the unit comprising:a computation device that periodically reads, either during a discharge from the battery or during a charge to the battery, a detected current from a current detection device, which detects a current corresponding to this point in time from among a discharge current flowing from the battery and a charge current flowing into the battery, and adds/subtracts a heat generation amount equivalent value in accordance with a value of the read detected current,wherein the computation device outputs the added/subtracted heat generation amount equivalent value as an estimated value representing the heat generation amount of the battery.
    2. The heat generation amount estimation unit for battery for electric power tool according to claim 1,wherein the computation device comprises an add/subtract value setting device that sets an add/subtract value in such a manner that, when the value of the detected current is less than a predetermined threshold value, a negative add/subtract value including zero is set such that the smaller the value of the detected current is, the greater an absolute value is; and, when the value of the detected current is equal to or greater than the predetermined threshold value, a positive add/subtract value is set such that the greater the value of the detected current is, the greater the add/subtract value is, andwherein the heat generation amount equivalent value is updated by adding the negative add/subtract value or the positive add/subtract value set by the add/subtract value setting device to the heat generation amount equivalent value.
    3. The heat generation amount estimation unit for battery for electric power tool according to claim 2,wherein the add/subtract value setting device sets the add/subtract value based on the value of the detected current and a detected temperature from a temperature detection device, which detects a temperature of the battery, such that the greater the value of the detected current is and the higher the detected temperature is, the greater the add/subtract value is.
    4. An apparatus for electric power tool comprising:the heat generation amount estimation unit for battery for electric power tool according to any one of claims 1 to 3; a determination device that determines whether or not the estimated value representing the heat generation amount of the battery obtained by the heat generation amount estimation unit has exceeded a set value for overheat determination set in advance; anda protection device that protects the battery by performing, if it is determined by the determination device that the estimated value has exceeded the set value, either of a suspension processing suspending an operation corresponding to this point in time from among the discharge from the battery and the charge to the battery and a limitation processing limiting the operation corresponding to this point in time from among the discharge from the battery and the charge to the battery.
    5. The apparatus for electric power tool according to claim 4,wherein, if it is determined by the determination device that the estimated value has exceeded the set value, the protection device limits either of the discharge from the battery and the charge to the battery by correcting a control threshold value used either for a discharge control of the battery or for a charge control of the battery.
    6. The apparatus for electric power tool according to claim 5,wherein, if it is determined by the determination device that the estimated value has exceeded the set value either during the discharge from the battery or during the charge to the battery, the protection device corrects a control threshold value used either during a next charge to the battery or during a next discharge from the battery.
    7. The apparatus for electric power tool according to any one of claims 3 to 6,wherein the apparatus is any of a battery pack containing the battery therein, an electric power tool main body to which the battery pack is detachably attached, and a battery charger to which the battery pack is detachably attached.
